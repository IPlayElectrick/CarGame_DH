Collect as many shiny stars as you can throughout the neighborhood!

## Description

A simple game that takes the player to a small neighborhood via controlling a car in order to collect as many stars as you can find throughout the town. Once you move the vehicle and it touches a star you will collect it. Your goal is to drive around and collect as many stars as you can. After a short amount of time the stars will reset so you will be able to collect stars you have already picked up once. The town will also have a barrier for that once you leave the town too much you will be teleported to the starting position of the game once again where you can start over.
